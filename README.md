Congratulations, you have answered the question correctly.

On the Path page, under Path, type %WINDIR%\regedit.exe, then Create.

If an AppLocker pop-up window is displayed regarding creating default rules, select Yes.

A Path rule simply denies the application from running based on the name and location of the file. If the file is moved or renamed, it will execute. The Hash rule generates a hash of the file, so even if the file is renamed or moved, it will still not execute. Hash rules use more overhead but are more restrictive.

Switch back to the PowerShell window.

gpupdate /force
Wait for the messages indicating that both the Computer Policy and User Policy updates have completed.
